    let num2 = num;

    num2 = 12;
    console.log(num,num2)

    let name = "Virat"

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = "lux"

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]
    const team4 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    // person.number = 67;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person}

    const hunter = {
        name : 'Hunter',
        age : 100,
        social : {
            twitter : '@hunter__',
            facebook: 'hunter'
        }
    };

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(hunter));

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
